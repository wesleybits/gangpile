#+TITlE: Gangpile

For when you need to run a script, repeatedly, and at scale.

* Build It
  1. ~go get~
  2. Build the bits; order doesn't matter:
     - ~go build gangpile.go~
     - ~go build localrunner.go~
     - ~go build remoterunner.go~ (to be implemented later)
  3. Get together the script you want to abuse
